4. Leather Wallet (Formerly Hiro Web Wallet)

Leather is the most widely used Bitcoin-connected wallet that supports Stacks and upcoming sBTC functionality.

Why developers integrate it:

Onboarding users quickly with simple auth

Supports STX, SIP-010 tokens, Ordinals & BTC

Enables sponsored transactions

Deep integration with Stacks.js

Great for miniapps, micro-dApps, and browser-based dApps.
