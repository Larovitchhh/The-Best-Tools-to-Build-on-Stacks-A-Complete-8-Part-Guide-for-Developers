1. Clarity Language & Developer Tooling

Clarity is the smart contract language used on Stacks. It’s deliberately non-Turing complete, making contract behavior predictable, readable, and verifiable.

Key features:

No compiler → code runs as written

Decidable → avoids hidden logic or unexpected behavior

Native Bitcoin interactions (via upcoming sBTC)

Essential tooling:

Clarinet (HIRO) for contracts, testing, simulations

Clarity REPL for quick prototypes

Clarity LSP for VSCode support
